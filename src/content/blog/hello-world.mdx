# Hello World

Welcome to my blog! This is my corner of the internet where I share thoughts on software engineering, technology, and the occasional life update.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- **Technical deep-dives** into interesting problems I've solved
- **Project showcases** with lessons learned
- **Career insights** from my journey in tech
- **Tool recommendations** and productivity tips

## About This Site

This portfolio is built with:

- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- MDX for blog posts
- A custom terminal interface for navigation

The terminal interface was inspired by classic command-line interfaces, bringing a retro aesthetic to modern web development.

## Get in Touch

Feel free to reach out if you have questions or just want to chat about tech. You can find my contact information by typing `contact` in the terminal on the home page.

Thanks for stopping by!

```bash
echo "Happy coding!"
```
